# Testing

- At the beginning all tests were written manually, and refactored into test_helper.rb. Now we use shoulda matchers
- Generated code is trusted and not tested at all
- Testing is done using fixtures
- Always approach via red-green-refactor. If not later it is impossible to check if newly written code is tested or not


# Resources

- Resources should never be nested more than 1 level deep 
- Almost each controller/resource is children of Users but due to the rule above they are kept separated not nested
- Everything must be a resource to follow the Rails way, exceptions must be very very well analysed
