# Testing

- Platform is tested manually using unit tests
- Unit tests are working very well (models, controllers and views)
- The red-green-refactor is working well
- All tests can be shared into test_helper.rb
- From now on scaffolds will be used with default tests, only models and any new code added will be tested
