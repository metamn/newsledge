Newsledge creates your own archive of thoughts and knowledge.

### How it works?

1. You are probably reading news every day and storing most important items
in Twitter, Tumblr, Delicious, Instapaper or other online services
2. You are probably marking up these news with tags
3. Newsledge imports all these items into one place and let's you browse in various ways


### Tags and Channels

The most important feature of Newsledge is collecting your information into various groups called tags and channels.

For example you might be interested in Ruby on Rails.  

So you are reading blogs about Rails and saving important articles into Delicios or Pinboard.in 
or other bookmarking services.  
Perhaps you are tagging them with #rails.  
And you write blog posts on your own blog (Tumblr, Posterous, Wordpress etc.) tagged #rails.

Also you follow people on Twitter related to Rails, retweet them with hashtag #rails, and post tweets with #rails.

...

And so on.
Newsledge presents in a single page all your content tagged with #rails on various platforms.  
Now you have a general overview about your thoughts and knowledge about Rails.

In plus, all #rails related tags are easily browsable on Newsledge to connect this piece of knowledge to other
pieces of knowledge. Consider #ecosystem, or #programming, or #web-development.

More, Newsledge let's you organise these tags into #channels.

Channels are a group of tags. They collect more topics into one single page for better overview.
